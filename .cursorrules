This is a self hosting (aspiring for now) c compiler written in c.
It compiles C code to x86-64 assembly, and then uses an external assembler and linker.
Because its self hosting, some constructs are not supported and should NOT be used when generating code:
no switch/case, no compound assignment, no macros apart from define, no for loop, no do-while loops.

The compiler can be built by running "ninja" in the build directory.
Tests are written using lit in the test directory. They can be run with "lit -v test/" in the build directory.
